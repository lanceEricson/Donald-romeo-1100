# :wave: Hello, I'm Lance Ericson.

I'm Romanov, **React, Node.js, Python, AI | SaaS, CRM, Cloud & Data Platforms** working remotely since 2022 :rocket:

## About me

🚀 I help startups and growing companies build scalable, secure, business-ready Full Stack solutions — from SaaS platforms and enterprise applications (CRM/ERP) to analytics dashboards, AI-powered features, and cloud-native systems.

I’m a Senior Full Stack Developer with 10+ years of experience, delivering end-to-end solutions from MVP to production-scale platforms. I combine strong engineering fundamentals, modern cloud architecture, and practical AI integration to build systems that align with real business goals and scale reliably.

I can work full time, 8+ hours a day, 6 days a week. I hope to work with you in a long time.
